  Allows you to quickly switch your System Default OpenXR Runtime between existing ones (currently SteamVR, Oculus/Meta, ViveVR, Windows Mixed Reality & Varjo) if installed & custom ones, which you can add manually to the program.

  I've made this because for example SteamVR only gives you the option to set it's Runtime as System Default OXR Runtime via the Developer Tab, when you've a Headset connected to it - which is/was annoying.
